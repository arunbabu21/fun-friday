Place images for Game 2 in this folder.

Path from the running app: `/assets/game2/`.

Example usage in a template (Game2):

<img src="/assets/game2/example.jpg" alt="Example image">

Notes:
- Add your image files here (jpg, png, svg).
- When building the app, files under `src/assets` are copied to `dist` and served from `/assets/`.
- In Angular templates you can also use relative paths like `assets/game2/example.jpg`.
